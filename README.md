## openapi-client-generator

A very simple prototype used to investigate how complicated it is to generate client library code from OpenAPI specifications.

### Projects

 - `openapi-client-generator-cli` - the CLI tool that runs the generator
 - `openapi-client-template-ts` - a template for generating TypeScript library code
 - `openapi-client-generator-test` - a simple demo that uses the generator


### Goals

 - the language template and generator should be separate ✔️
 - the template should be as simple as possible, with as much code as possible moved into helper functions and files
